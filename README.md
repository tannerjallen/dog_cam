# Dog Monitoring Camera 🐶📷

Ever wonder if your pup is sneaking onto the couch while you're away? This project uses a Wyze camera with an RTSP feed and some clever AI to catch couch-surfing canines in the act. Get alerts, track their mischief, and maybe even win the eternal battle of "No dogs on the couch!"
